# `loxygen-documentation-generator`

This package is a Luarocks module capable of generating extensive documentation for any Lua or Moonscript codebase.

Documentation is contributed by Lua symbols in the form of static comment markup prefaced by the `@` symbol ("tags").

These `@`-tags and surrounding markup are parsed by this library and used to generate Markdown output.

## Unique selling point



The package supports 52 documentation
